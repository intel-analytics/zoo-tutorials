    "This concludes our very first example -- you just saw how we could build and a train a neural network to classify handwritten digits. In the next chapter, we will go in detail over every moving piece we just previewed, and clarify what is really going on behind the scenes. You will learn about \"tensors\", the data-storing objects going into the network, about tensor operations, which layers are made of, and about gradient descent, which allows our network to learn from its training examples.\n",
